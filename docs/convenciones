### Writing Style

* Use US spelling and grammar.
* Direct, simple writing style
* Avoid long and complex words and grammar. Prefer simplicity so that text is accessible to non-native speakers
* Use acronyms only if they are commonly understood. Ideally, spell out the first use of an acronym followed by the acronym itself in parentheses (eg. `CLI (Command Line Interface)`).
* Use “and” instead of "&" or ampersan.
* Direct, simple writing style.
* Avoid long and complex words and grammar. Prefer simplicity so that text is accessible to non-native speakers.
* Use acronyms only if they are commonly understood. Ideally, spell out the first use of an acronym followed by the acronym itself in parentheses (eg. `CLI (Command Line Interface)`).
* Use words instead of numbers (from one to ten).
* Prefer active voice (eg. `To launch the application, click "Deploy" ) to passive voice (eg. `To launch the application, click "Deploy" instead of `The  “Delete” button is used for deleting the last changes`).
* Avoid telling the reader to do something by doing something else. (e.g. Use `To launch the application, click "Deploy"` instead of `Launch the application by clicking on the "Deploy" button`)
* Don't use "button" if you can avoid it. Instead of that, place a good and clear screenshot.·
* Write simple sentences avoiding long explanations (eg. Instead of `Using this new tool, you can optimize your Docker images` use `To optimize your Docker images, use the [example tool](www.example.com)`.
* Use gender neutral words and pronouns. Replace the masculine pronouns (his, he, himself) with either “you” or the plural.·
* Name the different menus, options and items with the exact name that appear in the software (eg. `Go to the “Settings” section instead Configuration section in the Reducing tool`).·

### Headings

* Format section titles as H2 (##).
* Format sub-section titles with H3 and H4.
* Use sentence case for all headings.
* Ensure that there is only one whitespace character between the heading symbols and the heading text.
* Write descriptive headings (eg.`How to configure your Kubernetes cluster in 5 steps` instead `Configuring a cluster`).
* Use a verb in the titles for steps (if your blog post contains instructions) instead of How to (eg. `Editing a file` instead `How to edit a file`).·
* Don't end headings with a period.
* Use sentence-style capitalization by capitalizing only the first word in a heading.

### Body

* Break long sentences into smaller, shorter ones.
* End all sentences with a period. Exception: if your sentence describes an operation which is shown on the next line (or screenshot), end it with a colon (eg. `Link a specific URL to your item as shown below:`).
* Use descriptive external links (eg. `Find more details [here]` is less descriptive than `Find more details in [Docker official documentation]`).
* Keep the parallel form. Start all steps with a verb (eg. `Click Edit`, `Select the item you want to edit`).

### Instructions

If you are writing a blog post that contains some instructions or steps to follow, please take into account the following:

* Start every section with a descriptive heading (eg. `Opening a new project`).·
* Add a short introductory statement that leads into the first numbered step.
* Avoid sections with more than 10 steps. Divide the instructions into smaller chunks.
* If so many steps are involved, list the steps first as an introduction.
* Group similar sections in different categories.
* Separate tasks in tasks units.
* Write only one idea per paragraph, develop only one argument or concept per content block or section.
* Use clear and short numbered steps.
* The instructions should be numbered steps, rather than a bulleted list.
* Use numbered lists only for instructions.
* Avoid using "you" in instructions (eg. instead of `you can click`, just use `click`).
* Start the sentences with an action verb.
* Use the conventional format for instructions (eg. `Click "View" and then "View HTML"`).

### Emphasis

* Use bolds for highlight important concepts (eg. `**Using the Kubernetes sandbox you can automate all the applications deployments.**`).
* Use italics for paths and filenames placeholders (eg. `Browse to *Users/Desktop/projects*` `In the *env.json* file, edit the following variables:`).
* Use capital letters for PLACEHOLDERS.
* Use quotation marks in Graphical User Interface (GUI) for sections, options, buttons, and fields in a form  (eg. `Navigate to the "Settings" section, then click "Languages and clock -> Timezone"`).
* Use `| NOTE: , `| TIP:, and `| IMPORTANT:` to create callout boxes to highlight important sentences. Add them at the end of the section instead between steps.·
* Use `$ commands` for commands.
* Code blocks: indicate when it is possible, the type of code block as follows:·

~~~json
check_or_build_nsenter() {
which nsenter >/dev/null && return 0
echo "INFO: Building 'nsenter' ..."
cat <<-EOF | docker run -i --rm -v "$(pwd):/build" ubuntu:14.04 >& nsenter.build.log
apt-get update
apt-get install -qy git bison build-essential autopoint libtool automake autoconf gettext pkg-config
git clone --depth 1 git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/util-linux/util-linux.git /tmp/util-linux
cd /tmp/util-linux
}
~~~

### Images

* Resize and compress all your images.
* Use lower-case filenames for all image files.
* Audit screenshots and always blur out personal or confidential information, such as usernames or IP addresses.
* Crop screenshots containing excessive visual elements/information to better focus on the relevant sections.
